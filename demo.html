                And when you are done checking the information, you need to know what they want or need, and after that, you need to choose what to answer them at the right corner of the screen. <br>
                - Choosing a correct answer(accept), the accuracy (100%) at the top right will remain the same, but if you choose the wrong one, it will decrease. Also, there is a score.
                of how many points you got; when the shift is done, you can see your remarks if you've passed the stage or not.
