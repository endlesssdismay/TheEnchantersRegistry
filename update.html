                <strong>Week 1</strong><br>
                - V0.1 <br>
                - We are currently working with V0.1 as of right now, but we want to add more versions later. <br>
                <br>
                - Our initial game menu is developed, however the buttons are not working. <br>
                <br>
                - The buttons include choices, training, start, and exit. We may have more features next time. This is all we have for this week. <br>
                <br>
                - With a straightforward concept, we are genuinely taking tiny steps toward improving our game one at a time, and we will soon have it finished. <br>

                <strong>Week 2</strong><br>
                - V0.1 <br>
                - We added a new feature this week that allows you to see our first game perspective.               <br>
                <br>
                - The start button is functional where a glass, table, and box are visible on the left. In other words,          <br>
                <br>
                - Although the other buttons are merely a simple design, they are not yet functional, and we are still working on what to add the next week.              <br>

                <strong>Week 3</strong><br>
                - V0.1 <br>
                - The first NPC was added, along with other features like choices and information that allow the user to interact with the NPC. <br>
                <br>
                - Interaction with the NPC is possible; the user will click the options in the box on the right. <br>
                <br>
                - We have advanced our first game development once more by adding elements that allow the user to pick what to do with the NPC.               <br>
            </p>
        </div>

                <strong>Week 4</strong><br>
                - V0.2 <br>
                - Now that we are on V0.2, we have fixed the designs and added more functions. <br>
                <br>
                - This makes it possible to see the information and options clearly. The user may now easily select options because they are plainly visible, along with the description of that NPC and the NPC dialogue. In other words, <br>
                <br>
                - The table is visible, and further design has been added to the picture. we made a little advancement once again, and not presume that it's a table. <br>
            </p>

                <strong>Week 5</strong><br>
                - V0.2 <br>
                - We haven't done much in this section this week; we have just solved the design and coding issues, so we haven't added many features. Instead, we have been debugging our game. <br>
                <br>
                - We have recently resolved the issue and are unsure of what to do next. Should we redo it or fix it? Therefore, we made the decision to only correct the flaws.  <br>
                <br>
                - We regret that we are unable to add many features at this time, so please be patient with us this week. I'll see you next week.               <br>
            </p>

                <strong>Week 6</strong><br>
                - V0.2 <br>
                - Week 5 hasn't changed; we're still merely creating the game and haven't added many features. <br>
                <br>
                - We are still working on the game's design and problem fixes. Please be patient with us as we consider what we will need to do after this part is fixed. <br>
                <br>
                - We are still working on addressing bugs when we add new features, but we pledge to add more next week. <br>
                <br>
                - I'm hoping we'll be able to show you guys something new we've done next week. This week was particularly troublesome for us because of the software's inherent faults in the scripts. <br>
            </p>
        </div>


         <div class="update-item">
            <img src="updatesw1-w12/w7.png" alt="Week 7">
            <p class="scroll">
                <strong>Week 7</strong><br>
                - We recently added something new to the design, and we are currently on V0.3. <br>
                <br>
                - We have now fixed the bugs from the previous week and included a new design element. <br>
                <br>
                - We corrected the fonts and added extra design. There are view ID, accept, and decline options, as you can see. When the user selects the see ID button, the NPC's details are displayed on the left. As for the accept and reject buttons, you can click accept if you've finished verifying the NPC and everything is in order, or deny the NPC if you notice something is wrong. <br>
                <br>
                - If something was wrong, the user can now choose whether to accept or reject the NPC. As a result, we have accomplished a great deal thus far, achieved V0.3, and will continue to do so. We've made additional advancements in our game. Thank you.    <br>
            </p>
        </div>

         <div class="update-item">
            <img src="updatesw1-w12/w8.png" alt="Week 8">
            <p class="scroll">
                <strong>Week 8</strong><br>
                - V0.4 <br>
                - I was surprised at how quickly we hit V0.4. It appears that our diligent back-end performed admirably in that regard. Having said that, we are now on V0.4. We have since added a ton more features.  <br>
                <br>
                - Unfortunately, not all of the buttons are working; the start button is no longer working since it was changed to training. We also added more design to the game menu's background and included a new button called "training," which allows the user to practice their skills. <br>
                <br>
                - As you can see at the top, the training began prior to the last week's photo.   <br>
                <br>
                - We introduced score points, which the player can get each time they correctly accept or reject the NPC. Points are awarded to the user if they are correct; points are subtracted if they are incorrect. Next time, I believe we should just ask our back-end.         <br>
            </p>
        </div>

         <div class="update-item">

                <strong>Week 9</strong><br>
                - V0.4 <br>
                - Last week, we introduced a training session where users can hone their skills by selecting the appropriate course of action about the NPC. <br>
                <br>
                - We included "shift complete." When the user completes the training, the system will indicate whether or not they performed well by providing a score and a comment.  <br>
                <br>
                - The user may easily practice and enhance their skills with that, and I think that our diligent back-end will enable us to introduce more features in the future. That being said, thank you, and see you next week. <br>
            </p>

                <strong>Week 10</strong><br>
                - V0.5 <br>
                - We are currently on V0.5 for this week; it appears that we are moving at a rapid pace. It's because of our back-end, as always. Having said that, we have once more introduced features. <br>
                <br>
                - The real game appears to have been added by the back-end. <br>
                <br>
                - Additional dialogues, choices, and NPCs have been added. In order for the player to enjoy the game, more NPCs were introduced. <br>
                <br>
                - We now have a percentage that appears in the upper right corner. If the user selects the correct option for the NPC, the percentage will be 100%; if not, it will drop each time the user selects the incorrect option. <br>
                <br>
                - The NPC displays the number of correct decisions you made during the completed shift, and as usual, the user receives a score and a comment. And because to our diligent back-end, we were able to reach the V0.5 so quickly. We'll be introducing additional features next week, so stay tuned. I'll see you again, and thank you. <br>
            </p>

                <strong>Week 11</strong><br>
                - V0.5 <br>
                - Although we are still at version 0.5, we have just added a few button functionalities and other features. <br>
                <br>
                - A pause button and credits were added. In addition to adding a few more buttons to the game, these buttons are now operational. <br>
                <br>
                - A bug was fixed in the code and training. This week, we were only able to debug the game and implement some of our professor's recommendations because we were unable to add anything more. It took a lot of time, and we hardly made it. I'm grateful for this week and will see you soon.

                - V0.5<br>
                - We hardly introduced any features this week because of the impending test and other tasks that fit into our timetable.   <br>
                <br>
                - We only improve the recommendations we made last week and troubleshoot and verify the game's malfunctioning features. <br>
                <br>
                - We were considering redesigning, redoing, or adding more features to the game, but in order to focus on other issues, we decided to put it on hold for the time being and return the following week. We apologize for the inconvenience this week and hope you will wait for the next update while we are getting ready for the test. Much obliged. <br>

                <strong>Week 13</strong><br>
                - V0.6<br>
                - We were able to reach the new version, V0.6, this week. We added more features this week, but we had a lot of free time last week because we were concentrating on our exam. <br>
                <br>
                - Since we implemented our professor's advice, we were able to fix the start gameplay. As a result, we added three levels to the gameplay: check-in, complain, and check-out. <br>
                <br>
                - We are currently working on level 1, however only level 1 is accessible; the remaining levels have not yet been developed. <br>
                <br>
                - In previous iterations of our gameplay, you were limited to selecting the correct options; you could only select one consumer before moving on to another. However, in this edition, you are conversing with the customer.  <br>
                <br>
                - We had a lot on our plate last week, but this week we added more, and we're excited for next week. Thank you.

                - V0.6<br>
                - We corrected the problematic feature and added more. <br>
                <br>
                - Level 2 of the game has been added; the user can now progress from level 1 to level 2, albeit the last stage is still unfinished. <br>
                <br>
                - You will receive a notification at the end of the stage indicating whether you completed it or not; if not, you will have to restart it. <br>
                <br>
                - Customers at level 2 are those that are dissatisfied with other patrons or who have issues throughout their stay, which is similar to level 1. <br>
                <br>
                - Next time, we'll include more. I'll see you later. Thank you.

                - This week, we expanded our gameplay to include three new levels. <br>
                <br>
                - Now that we've completed every stage, the user can continue playing till the end of the game.  <br>
                <br>
                - The hardest part will be concentrating on either correcting the gameplay, especially the problematic parts, or adding more features.  <br>
                <br>
                - We intend to include leaderboards, but we are not entirely certain about this, so let's wait until the next week to see if we will move forward with this plan. <br>
                <br>
                - With that, we'll be adding more, so please wait for the following updates and see you then. Thanks.
