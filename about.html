                <strong>About Us</strong><br>           
             In the hospitality industry, front desk personnel play a crucial role in shaping the guest experience. 
             From the moment a guest arrives, their interaction with the front desk sets the tone for their entire stay. 
             <br><br>
             However, training individuals to handle guest interactions effectively can be challenging, as traditional 
             methods such as lectures, roleplay, or static training videos often lack engagement and real-world complexity.
            <br><br>
            Our general objective is to design and develop a game-based learning environment that
            simulates front desk guest interactions. To evaluate the game’s ability to enhance communication skills, active
            listening, and professionalism. To increase learner engagement compared to traditional training
            methods. <br> <br>

                The Enchanter’s Registry as a
                desktop-based educational game that simulates front desk communication and problemsolving scenarios. The content is limited to front desk interactions such as greeting
                guests, verifying information, and responding to requests or issues.
                <br> <br>
                The game is developed exclusively for Windows desktop platforms. It does not
                cover mobile, console, or macOS devices. Scenarios are limited to role-play
                interactions and do not extend to other hospitality functions such as housekeeping or
                food service. The study measures educational impact in terms of communication skills
                and confidence, not technical hospitality operations.
                <br> <br>
                This study contributes to the growing field of game-based learning in vocational
                training. By combining fantasy storytelling with realistic hospitality scenarios, it
                provides a unique tool for skill development that could be adapted to multiple industries. Its innovative approach can lead to higher retention of communication skills, greater
                learner motivation, and a more positive training experience.

                Our game was inspired by the game called "That's not my neighbor",  is a 2D job simulator and horror game 
                where you play as a doorman in 1955 tasked with identifying and preventing doppelgangers (monsters that mimic humans)
                from entering your apartment building.<br><br>
