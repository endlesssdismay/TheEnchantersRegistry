        <strong>The Enchanter’s Registry</strong>
         as a desktop-based educational game that simulates front desk communication and problemsolving scenarios. The content is limited to front desk interactions such as greeting guests, verifying information, and responding to requests or issues.
         <br><br>
         In the hospitality industry, front desk personnel play a crucial role in shaping
         the guest experience. From the moment a guest arrives, their interaction with the front
         desk sets the tone for their entire stay. However, training individuals to handle guest
         interactions effectively can be challenging, as traditional methods such as lectures,
         roleplay, or static training videos often lack engagement and real-world complexity.
         <br><br>
         This study focuses on developing and testing The Enchanter’s Registry as a
         desktop-based educational game that simulates front desk communication and problemsolving scenarios. The content is limited to front desk interactions such as greeting
         guests, verifying information, and responding to requests or issues.
         <br><br>
         Our general objective is to design and develop a game-based learning environment that
         simulates front desk guest interactions. To evaluate the game’s ability to enhance communication skills, active
         listening, and professionalism. To increase learner engagement compared to traditional training
         methods.
